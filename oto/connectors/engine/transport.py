"""The transport of a request to the vendor, over `requests`, as oto-core's HTTP client sends it.

- No redirect is followed: a 3xx is an answer like any status outside 2xx.
- The delay of the function (`timeout_s`, else the connector's, else 30 s) bounds the connection and each read
  (`requests`' timeout: each wait, not the whole exchange).
- The pace of the vendor (`connector.rate_limit`), per credential and per process: a request waits for a place in the
  window of its credential.
- A 429 is replayed twice at most, after the vendor's `Retry-After` when it is 10 s or less (1 s when unreadable); a
  401 is replayed once on a fresh signature when the authentication renews (a token exchange).
- An answer is read up to 4 MiB; a success is JSON (empty: `None`), or `UnreadableAnswer`.
- A guarded address (`address.guard`) is checked before each request.

No secret, no address and no header leaves here in a message or a cause: a failure of `requests` (its message carries
the address, a key in its query included) becomes `Unreachable`, raised without its cause.
