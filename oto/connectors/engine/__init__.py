"""The engine: runs a function of a description, as oto-core's engine runs it for oto 2 (docs/conception/fabrique.md,
« Le moteur Python »).

    from oto.connectors import descriptions, engine

    result = engine.call(descriptions.load("serper"), "search", {"q": "oto"}, credential={"api_key": key})

`call(description, function, arguments, *, credential, settings=None, session=None) -> dict`:

- `description`: a served description (`oto.connectors.descriptions.load`), or any description in the same form;
- `function`: the name of one of its functions; `arguments`: its arguments, already validated by the host against the
  function's served input (JSON Schema 2020-12), pagination's `all_pages` and `max_pages` included;
- `credential`: the value of each credential field (a service account's whole JSON key file in its one field) of the connector, by name, the fields `holder: host` merged in by
  the host. The engine reads no secret anywhere else, neither environment nor file;
- `settings`: the account's settings, by name (a `choice` absent takes its default);
- `session`: the `requests.Session` to send with (a test passes a fake one); without it, a session of the engine's
  own, which reads nothing of the environment.

It returns what the caller receives (`serve.result`): with `output.items`, `{items, next_cursor, pages}`; otherwise the
first answer shaped, `{}` for no content, `{"value": …}` for a value that is not an object. `execute` takes the same
arguments and returns the raw answers and the cursor (`Pages`), for a host that reads them itself (the probe,
`serve.probe_health`).

What it raises is in `oto.connectors.engine.errors`; the mark of an account (`marks_account`), its lifting at the first
success and the cost of a call stay with the host.
