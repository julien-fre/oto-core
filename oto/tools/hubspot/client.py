"""HubSpot CRM API client (v3).

Auth = **private app access token** (Bearer). Created in HubSpot:
Settings → Integrations → Private Apps → scopes `crm.objects.*` (read/write).
Passed in clear text to the constructor.

Generic surface over CRM objects: `contacts`, `companies`, `deals`,
`tickets` (and any custom object) share the same verbs
(`list/get/search/create/update/delete` + associations). Notes/engagements
have a dedicated helper because they attach to an object via an association.

Three properties of this client are worth knowing before calling it:

- **A 429 is retried, bounded; nothing else is retried.** A private app is
  allowed 190 requests / 10 s, and a CRM sync phase makes ~4 per lead:
  ~40 leads are enough to hit the ceiling. A 429 says the request was REFUSED
  (nothing was done), so replaying it has no side effects; a 5xx does not say
  whether the write went through, and replaying it would create a duplicate in a CRM. See
  `_request`.
  ⚠️ **This changes the FAILURE TIME of ALL calls of this client**, not
  just new ones: a 429 that used to return its named refusal in ≤ 30 s can
  now hold the caller for up to ~110 s before returning the SAME
  `UpstreamHTTPError(429)`. A caller with a shorter deadline than that
  will get a timeout — an anonymous refusal instead of a named one. The bound is
  on SLEEP, not on wall-clock time: the numbers are worked out above
  `RATE_LIMIT_ATTEMPTS`.
- **`batch_read_objects` returns an ENVELOPE, not a list**:
  `{"results": [...], "missing_ids": [...]}`. `missing_ids` is the only place where
  you can tell that a page shrank (HubSpot answers 207 for a vanished id, so nothing
  raises). The full contract is in its docstring — it is authoritative.
- **`batch_read_objects` is STRICT about property names**, unlike the
  single GET: a property absent from the portal makes a 400
  `PROPERTY_DOESNT_EXIST` on the ENTIRE slice, it does not come back empty. This is
  the trap the caller inherits when moving from N single reads to one
  batched read.

# ⚠️ WHAT IS BOUNDED, EXACTLY — and what is not:
#   • SLEEP is bounded per LOGICAL OPERATION, not per HTTP call.
#     `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_TOTAL_SLEEP` in total, whether the operation fits in one request
#     or in three slices of `batch_read_objects` (see `_RetryBudget`). That
#     bound is ABSOLUTE: it does not move with the number of ids.
#   • NETWORK WAIT TIME, on the other hand, IS NOT bounded at the operation level.
#     Each HTTP call carries its 30 s transport timeout, and an operation makes
#     as many as it has slices. HONEST worst case of a `batch_read_objects`:
#         slices × RATE_LIMIT_ATTEMPTS × 30 s  +  RATE_LIMIT_MAX_TOTAL_SLEEP
#     i.e., for 250 ids (3 slices), 9 × 30 + 20 = 290 s. A caller that has a
#     deadline sets it ITSELF: this client does not know it.
#   • raising `RATE_LIMIT_ATTEMPTS` therefore EXTENDS the worst case, by one HTTP
#     round trip (up to 30 s) per added attempt. It is not a free setting,
#     and that is the term that weighs — not the sleep, which is capped.

              "results":     [ <HubSpot record>, ... ],   # list[dict]
              "missing_ids": [ "<requested id>", ... ],   # list[str]
            }

        - `results`: the concatenation, in slice order, of the `results` arrays
          returned by HubSpot. Each element is the RAW HubSpot record,
          untouched (`{"id": str, "properties": {...}, "createdAt":
          …, "updatedAt": …, "archived": bool}`). ⚠️ The order is that of the HubSpot
          RESPONSES, NOT that of the requested `ids`, and HubSpot does not guarantee it:
          a caller that needs its input order indexes on `id`.
        - `missing_ids`: the REQUESTED ids (as `str`, deduplicated, in input
          order) for which no record came back. `[]` when everything came back.
        - No usable id in input ⇒ `{"results": [], "missing_ids": []}` and
          ZERO HTTP calls.
        - A slice that fails RAISES (`UpstreamHTTPError`): never a half page
          passing for the whole list, never a silent partial return.

        ⚠️ `missing_ids` is a LOCAL DIFF (what was requested minus what came
        back), not a reading of the error body: an id that is deleted, archived or
        from another portal is simply ABSENT from `results` and HubSpot answers
        207 — so `raise_for_upstream` does not raise. Without this tally, a page of
        250 members would come back as 247 rows without anyone learning of it:
        that is the "disguised success" the house refuses. A caller that throws away
        `missing_ids` reopens that hole.

        ⚠️ **Sleep bounded for the WHOLE operation, not per slice.** The slices
        share ONE `_RetryBudget`: the cumulative waits on 429 stay under
        `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_TOTAL_SLEEP` whatever the number of ids. WALL-CLOCK time,
        on the other hand, is not bounded at the operation level — it grows with the number of
        slices (each HTTP call carries its 30 s transport timeout). The
        worst-case computation is written above `RATE_LIMIT_ATTEMPTS`.

        Args:
            object_type: contacts | companies | deals | tickets | custom object.
            ids: the ids (or, with `id_property`, the values of that property).
                Deduplicated keeping input order; empty ones are dropped.
            properties: INTERNAL names of the properties to return. ⚠️ `batch/read` is
                STRICT about this, unlike the single GET: a property
                absent from the portal makes a 400 `PROPERTY_DOESNT_EXIST` on the
                whole slice, it does not come back empty. ⚠️ `[]` and `None` are
                treated the SAME — the `properties` key is omitted from the body and HubSpot
                returns its DEFAULT projection. An empty list therefore does not ask for
                "zero columns": if the caller means that, it is up to THEIR surface
                to refuse it by name.
            id_property: read by uniqueness key (`email`…) instead of the record id.
                It is then ADDED to the requested `properties` if it is not
                there — without it in the response, `missing_ids` would be incomputable
                (the `results` are keyed on the record id, not on the key). The
                comparison is exact first, then case-insensitive:
                HubSpot normalizes some keys (an email comes back lowercased),
                and flagging those rows in `missing_ids` would be false.
