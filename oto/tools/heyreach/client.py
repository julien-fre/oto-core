"""HeyReach public API client (https://api.heyreach.io/api/public) — LinkedIn outreach
automation: campaigns and the leads they work on, lead lists, leads and their tags,
the LinkedIn inbox of the sender accounts, statistics and webhooks.

The client of the `heyreach` description (`connectors/heyreach/connector.yaml`): one
method per function, named like it, with its arguments; answers are returned as parsed
JSON, without the addresses an agent must not see (`STRIP`).

## Account

One API key per HeyReach workspace, sent in the `X-API-KEY` header. It acts on every
sender account, campaign, list and conversation of the workspace. Keys never expire but
can be deleted or deactivated (401).

## Protocol facts that shape a caller

- **Most lists are POST with `{offset, limit}`** (up to 100 per page, 1000 for the
  leads of a list): next page = offset + limit while offset < totalCount. The inbox
  (`list_conversations`, GetConversationsV3) pages by cursor: pass `nextCursor` back
  as `cursor` while `hasNextPage`.
- **Leads are sent with HeyReach's own keys** (`profileUrl`, `firstName`,
  `customUserFields`…), as given, at most 100 per call; a custom field name is
  letters, digits and `_`.
- **Several gestures answer 200 with an empty body** (pause, resume, stop a lead, send
  a message, set the seen status, the key check): `{}` is returned.
- **Never redirected, never retried**: the key travels in a custom header, which
  `requests` would forward to another host, and a send must not be repeated.
- **Rate limit: 300 requests per minute for the whole workspace** (429 above).
