                issued the `request_id` has already been billed). Requires `webhook_url`.

            the CALL, not at the result: Apollo bills the empty shell it fabricates
            itself — measured, ~12 credits for zero data (commit `44acc08`) — and nothing
            has ever shown that a non-match is refunded. A caller that returns a
            failure message must therefore assert NOTHING about cost: neither "no credit
            spent", nor "retry", which would present a second paid call as
            free. Either we measure the billing, or we stay silent on it.

        ⚠️ **A weak identifier costs a credit for nothing.** `search_people` returns
        OBFUSCATED family names ("Vi***l"): matching with `first_name` + company
        alone does not find the person, Apollo creates a stub and bills anyway

        This is the endpoint that gives the **ids** that `update_contact` requires:
        `typed_custom_fields` is keyed by ID, not by name. Without this catalog we
        cannot write a custom field, only guess it.

        ⚠️ **Apollo marks this endpoint deprecated in favor of `GET /fields`
        (source=custom) — we stay HERE deliberately, and this choice must not be
        "modernized" without checking this point**: the two catalogs do not return
        the same id shape. `typed_custom_fields` returns the BARE ObjectId
        (`"<objectid>"`, 24 hex), which is exactly the key expected by
        `PATCH /contacts/{id}`; `/fields` returns an id PREFIXED with its modality
        (`"account.<objectid>"`, `"contact.id"`), which no doc
        allows us to split. Taking the "modern" catalog would therefore make us
        write keys that Apollo silently ignores, while returning 200.
