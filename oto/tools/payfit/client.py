"""PayFit API client (https://partner-api.payfit.com) — payroll and HR software.

Reference: https://developers.payfit.io (API Reference, OpenAPI 3.0 "Partner API"
v1.0, read 2026-09-17). Paths, query parameters and envelopes below come from it.

Auth is a company API key sent as `Authorization: Bearer {api_key}`. A key is
created by an admin of the company in the PayFit app (Integrations → API),
carries the scopes chosen at creation, and gives access to that company only.

## Company id

Every path hangs under `/companies/{companyId}`. The id is not typed by the
caller: it is read from the token introspection endpoint
(`POST https://oauth.payfit.com/introspect`, body `{"token": ...}`), which
answers `{active, scope, company_id}`. The same answer gives the key's scopes
(`get_key_scopes`): what the key may read and write is chosen at its creation in
PayFit. Both are cached process-wide, keyed by a
hash of the key — a server builds one client per call, so a cache held by the
instance would introspect on every call.

## Scope of this client

**Everything the Partner API documents**, read and write:

- the company (global and French variants), the monthly payroll status;
- the collaborators (directory, creation), their contracts (global and French
  variants, creation), the worked time of a month;
- the absences (list, creation of an already-approved one, cancellation);
- the payslips (metadata and PDF), the company documents (PDF), the UK income
  tax and auto-enrolment documents;
- the payroll accounting of a month (structured entries and the raw export) and
  the bank payment file;
- the health-insurance and provident-fund contracts, an employee's affiliation
  to them and a regularization request;
- the meal vouchers of a month.

Two documented endpoints have **no method here**, and both are a deliberate
absence rather than an oversight:

- `POST /companies/{companyId}/billing-declarations` declares a PayFit
  *reseller's* billed volumes. It writes into PayFit's own billing of a partner,
  not into the company's HR data — nothing an HR or finance caller should reach.
- `POST /companies-fr/{companyId}/health-insurance-setup-sheets` uploads a PDF
  and an XML as `multipart/form-data`. A client method would have to take file
  bytes it has no way to obtain here.

⚠️ Responses EMBED personal data, depending on the scopes the key carries: a
collaborator may come with social security number, IBAN/BIC, birth date,
nationality, personal addresses, phones and emails; a French contract with the
social security number and the reason of termination; an absence with a type
that names a sick leave or a work accident; a payslip and an accounting entry
with pay. This client returns responses as the API sends them; **reducing them
is the caller's decision** — a key created with only the scopes a use needs is
the first reduction, and oto-backend applies a per-org field-redaction policy on
top.

## Protocol facts that shape a caller

- Lists are paginated by `maxResults` (1-50, default 10) and an opaque
  `nextPageToken`, and answer `{<items>: [...], meta: {nextPageToken, count}}`.
- A **month** is `YYYYMM` (January is `01`), never `YYYY-MM` — `payment-files`,
  `accounting`, `accounting-v2`, `payroll-status`, `contracts/time` and
  `meal-vouchers` all take it and all reject the dashed form.
- `/contracts-fr` is the French variant of `/contracts`: it adds DSN fields
  (contract nature, conventional status, IDCC), the working time modality
  (`forfait_jours`…) and the insurance contract ids. Its deprecated `fields`
  query parameter is never sent.
- Absences default to status `approved` upstream; `status="all"` returns every
  status. A created absence is **already approved** — there is no approval
  workflow in this API.
- Four endpoints answer **bytes, not JSON** (payslip PDF, company document PDF,
  accounting export, payment file): they go through `_get_file`, which never
  calls `.json()`.
- `DELETE /absences/{id}` carries a JSON body (the cancellation comment) —
  unusual, but that is what the spec documents.
- Rate limits: 50 read requests per second per client application; a 429
  surfaces as `UpstreamHTTPError` like any other non-2xx — not retried here.
