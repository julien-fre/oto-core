#
# `relation-requests` is paginated by OFFSET on the Unipile side, not by cursor — so it
# NEVER returns a `next_cursor`. To keep the tool's contract
# ("call me again with the returned cursor"), we FABRICATE this token and
# decode it again on input: it is NEVER forwarded upstream. The prefix makes it
# readable in logs and prevents any collision if Unipile ever ended up returning
# a real one (in which case upstream wins, see `list_invitations`).
#
# The token ALSO carries the fingerprint of the page that produced it, and that is
# the mechanical stop: that `offset` actually paginates this endpoint was never
# verified against the real service. If the assumption is wrong, upstream ignores
# `offset` and serves the same page forever — without a fingerprint, the calling
# loop NEVER stops (simulated: 8 pages, 400 rows returned for 50
# distinct ones). By comparing the returned page to the previous turn's one, we cut
# at the 2nd call. The `off:<n>` form without a fingerprint is still decoded: a cursor
# returned by an earlier version doesn't break mid-flight.

        ⚠️ This endpoint is paginated by `offset`, NOT by cursor. Unipile:
        "Pagination for this endpoint works with the `offset` parameter." It
        therefore never returns a `next_cursor`, and it REFUSES any param other than
        `limit`/`meta_only` alongside a `cursor`:

            Unipile 400: When cursor is provided, only "limit" and "meta_only"
            are allowed alongside it. Unexpected parameters: type.

        Since `type` is REQUIRED, sending a `cursor` was a dead end: page 1
        passed, every following page returned 400 — the invitations pagination
        was dead beyond the first screen, with nothing signaling it on the schema
        side (the tool announced "Paginated"). So we paginate by
        `offset` and FABRICATE the returned cursor (see `_invitations_cursor`)
        to keep the tool's contract.

        Advances by `limit` per page — Unipile contract: "increment the offset
        by the limit" — and stops when `data` is EMPTY, not on a short
        page: the provider can filter items WITHIN the window, and
        advancing by `len(data)` would then serve the same ones again. For an
        exhaustive export, deduplicate by `id` anyway.

        ⚠️ MECHANICAL STOP. That `offset` actually paginates this endpoint was
        never verified against the real service. If the assumption is wrong,
        upstream ignores `offset` and serves the same page every turn: the
        calling loop would never stop. The returned cursor therefore carries
        the fingerprint of the page that produced it, and NO cursor is fabricated
        when the returned page is identical to the previous turn's one — the
        loop then stops at the 2nd call, and `pagination_note` says why.

        failure mode here, an empty page precisely never happens in this case."""
