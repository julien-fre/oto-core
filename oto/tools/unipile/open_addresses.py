"""Addresses that open content without a LinkedIn login, dropped from the answers.

No such address reaches the caller: the picture of a member, a company, a
school or an organisation, the picture of a conversation, and the tracking
pixel of a job posting open for anyone who holds them. Each answer drops them
by dotted path (`OPEN_ADDRESS_FIELDS`), keyed by the function of the
description `linkedin_unipile` that describes the call, and the description
strips the same paths (`output.strip`). Profile addresses (`profile_url`),
behind a LinkedIn login, stay; so does an address of the Unipile API itself
(`private_picture_download_url`, a message attachment), which needs the key.

The paths come from the answers of the Unipile v2 reference: relative to the
answer, or to each element of `data` for a list.
