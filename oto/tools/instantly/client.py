"""Instantly API V2 client (https://developer.instantly.ai) — cold email outreach: the
workspace, campaigns and their analytics, leads, lead lists and labels, the Unibox (emails
sent and received, a reply), sending accounts, the block list and webhooks.

The client of the `instantly` description (`connectors/instantly/connector.yaml`): one method
per function, named like it, with its arguments; answers are Instantly's JSON, two removals
aside (below). API V1 is deprecated and never called.

## Account

One workspace API key, sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, on
`https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2`. A key carries SCOPES chosen when it is created
(`resource:read|create|update|delete|all`, and the wildcards `all:read`, `all:all`): a read-only
key answers 403 to every action. The key is never put in an address.

## Protocol facts that shape a caller

- **Cursor paging**: `limit` (1 to 100) and `starting_after`, the previous answer's
  `next_starting_after`; a page without it is the last.
- **Query booleans** are sent `true` / `false`; a list argument repeats its key (`ids=a&ids=b`).
- **No body, no Content-Type**: activating or pausing a campaign and marking a thread read are
  POSTs without a body, sent without a JSON content type (an empty JSON body is refused).
- **Never retried, never redirected**: a write (a reply, leads added to a campaign) may have
  gone through on a 5xx or a timeout. `GET /emails` is limited to 20 requests per minute.
- **Removed from every answer**: a webhook's `headers` (delivered to its destination, they may
  carry its secret) and an email attachment's `url` (a download address that opens without a
  login). Nothing else is changed.
